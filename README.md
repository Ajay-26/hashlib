# hashlib

A lot of my friends expressed difficult finding a good SHA256 library in C++. Of course, there are great SHA256 libraries such as Crypto++, and I don't claim to be better than them by any means, but I thought, I'd have a crack at building a SHA256 hashing library on my own. The time taken to hash a string of average length (around 50 characters) was approximately 40 microseconds. I did not use multithreading or any sort of parallelisation, but plan to do so in the future. I tried to make it as fast as possible, but given my limited experience, I am sure that there are several optimisations that can be made. The objective of this library is to get some experience coding under my belt, as well as making a library which my friends can easily use for their assignments (one of them is very cute I hope she uses it in particular)
